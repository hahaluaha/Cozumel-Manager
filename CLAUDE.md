# Cozumel Manager Project

## Overview
Native Mac Silicon app for managing premium vacation rentals in Cozumel.
Properties: Nah Ha 101, Casa Bohemia, Cool Caribbean Views.

## Tech Stack
- Frontend: SwiftUI (Native macOS, targets macOS 14+)
- Data: Local JSON → moving to Supabase (not yet wired)
- Logic: Revenue forecasting and manual property oversight
- Auto-update: Sparkle 2 (SPM, v2.9.3) — `SPUStandardUpdaterController` (not `SPUUpdaterController`)

## Commands
```bash
# Open project
open CozumelManager/CozumelManager.xcodeproj

# Build & run: Cmd+R in Xcode
# Archive for distribution: Product → Archive → Distribute App → Direct Distribution

# CLI build (for scripted/headless builds)
xcodebuild -project CozumelManager/CozumelManager.xcodeproj -scheme CozumelManager -configuration Debug -derivedDataPath <dir> build
```

Bundle ID: `Team-Paraiso.CozumelManager`. Sandboxed data file lives at
`~/Library/Containers/Team-Paraiso.CozumelManager/Data/Library/Application Support/CozumelManager/properties.json`
(not `~/Library/Application Support` directly — this is an App Sandbox container path).

**Any build with this bundle ID shares that one container** — a throwaway
Debug test build reads/writes the same file as the shipped app already
running on this Mac. `PropertyStore` only seeds from the bundled JSON on
first launch (no existing file); an already-migrated container keeps its
real data regardless of which build touches it. Treat manual test builds
as operating on real data, not fixtures, unless you've confirmed otherwise.

GUI apps fully buffer stdout when piped to a file — `print()` debugging via
`nohup App.app/Contents/MacOS/App > log.txt &` won't show output until the
process exits unless you call `setvbuf(stdout, nil, _IONBF, 0)` at app init first.

```

## Architecture
- `PropertyStore` is created once in `CozumelManagerApp` and injected via `.environmentObject` — do not recreate it in views
- App uses `Window` scene (not `WindowGroup`) — intentionally single-window
- `Property.Hashable` uses `id` only — intentional, do not change to full-field synthesis
- `monthlyRevenue` returns `0` for `.inactive` and `.maintenance` properties — required for accurate `totalMonthlyRevenue`
- `Property.monthlyPrice: Double?` is an optional manual override; when set, it replaces the nightly-rate × 22 estimate in `monthlyRevenue` (still 0 for inactive/maintenance)

## SwiftUI Gotchas (IMPORTANT)
- `.onChange(of:)` does not fire on this Xcode 26 beta / macOS 26.5 SDK toolchain — confirmed across TextField, Picker, and TextEditor; reproduced identically via `xcodebuild`+`open`, direct-exec launch, and native Xcode Cmd+R
- Use `.onSubmit { commit() }` (TextField, fires on Return) or an explicit `Button` action instead of `.onChange` to trigger saves — both are plain closures, unaffected by the bug
- `TextEditor` has no submit-on-Return equivalent — pair it with an explicit "Save" button
- Re-verify this once Xcode/macOS moves off this beta; don't assume it's fixed without retesting `.onChange` directly

## Sparkle 2 Auto-Update (IMPORTANT)
- Class is `SPUStandardUpdaterController` — NOT `SPUUpdaterController` (that class does not exist in Sparkle 2.9.3)
- `SUFeedURL` and `SUPublicEDKey` are injected into Info.plist via a PlistBuddy shell script build phase — Xcode 26's SwiftBuild drops third-party `INFOPLIST_KEY_*` entries silently, so the standard approach does not work
- `ENABLE_USER_SCRIPT_SANDBOXING = NO` in build settings — required for the PlistBuddy script to write to the app bundle at build time; does NOT affect the app's runtime sandbox
- Signing tools: `~/sparkle-tools/generate_keys` and `~/sparkle-tools/sign_update` (local only, not in repo)
- Private signing key is in Keychain under service `https://sparkle-project.org` — never commit it
- appcast.xml is hosted at `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hahaluaha/Cozumel-Manager/master/appcast.xml` (master branch, repo is public)

## Secrets Management (Pre-Supabase — IMPORTANT)
- Never put API keys in source files or `properties.json`
- Keys flow: `Config/Secrets.xcconfig` → `Info.plist` preprocessor macro → `Bundle.main.object(forInfoDictionaryKey:)`
- `com.apple.security.network.client` is already in `CozumelManager.entitlements` (added for Sparkle) — Supabase will use the same entitlement
- When adding any new entitlement, add it to `CozumelManager.entitlements` — not build settings
- Use Supabase Swift SDK typed filter methods only — no string interpolation into queries

## Manual GUI Verification (no screen recording permission available)
- `screencapture` may fail with "could not create image from display" — fall
  back to macOS accessibility scripting instead of screenshots:
  `osascript` + System Events (`tell application "System Events" to tell process ...`),
  reading `entire contents of window "..."` for a flat list of UI elements
  (role/title/value), and `click` on elements matched by `description`.
- `open App.app` re-activates an already-running instance sharing the same
  bundle ID instead of launching your build — use `open -n` to force a new
  process, then target it in System Events by PID (`every process whose
  unix id is N`), never by name (`tell process "AppName"` is ambiguous
  with multiple instances and silently grabs the wrong one).
- Debug builds under this Xcode/SwiftBuild toolchain split into a thin
  launcher (`Contents/MacOS/<App>`, ~60KB) plus `<App>.debug.dylib` (the
  real code). Grepping/`nm`-ing the launcher for your new symbols will
  find nothing — check the `.debug.dylib`.

## Instructions
- Keep logic focused on luxury management
- Kelley handles staff manually — no auto-routing features
- No auto-booking, no guest messaging, no staff scheduling
